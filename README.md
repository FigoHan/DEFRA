The aim is to find a link between concentrations of chemical substances in wastewater treatment works effluent and economic activity in the corresponding area. There is a large CIP dataset available, but the method to link that to regional economic activity will be determined by the project. The objective is to see if the data can tell us anything about what types of economic activity lead to increased concentration levels and hence potentially higher exposure in the environment and in drinking water.

The expected output would include a description with some summary statistics of how concentrations of key chemicals of interest vary across England and the associated variation in economic activity. Ideally, it would be possible to show the results of cross-sectional regression, but the data may only lend itself to descriptive statistics.

Data set: The main concentrations dataset is publicly available at the Chemical Investigations Programme Data Access Portal (ukwir.org). Economic data is available from the ONS website and other government sites.
